husk %VERSION%

husk is a natural language wrapper around the Linux iptables packet filtering.
It is designed to abstract the sometimes confusing syntax of iptables into
a format that is easier and friendlier to read and understand.

husk can be used on either firewall/router computers (with multiple network
interfaces), or standalone systems (with one network interface)

Each interface (real or virtual) is called a 'zone' in husk. Zones are given
a friendly name which is what is used in the rule definitions. This abstracts
the Linux device names (eg, eth0, ppp0, bond0 etc) into much more intuitive
names such as NET, LAN and DMZ. This has the added benefit of moving interfaces
in the future can be done simply by changing the name-to-device mapping.
