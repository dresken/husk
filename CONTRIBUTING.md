# Contributing

-----------------------

Since husk is open-source, contributions are very welcome. Contributions can be code (in the form of GitHub pull requests), documentation, or testing and feedback/bug reporting. If you want to contribute code but aren't sure where to start, check the [Issue tracker](https://github.com/fukawi2/husk/issues) for outstanding tasks. Relatively simple tasks are labeled with "*Newbie*" to help you identify tasks that aren't too complex to get you started.

All code contributions must be made by forking the `develop` branch via GitHub, then submitting pull requests. Please ensure your work is done on a feature branch that has been branched from `develop`. Do **NOT** work directly on `master` or `develop`. Check [this document for preferred workflow](https://openshift.redhat.com/community/wiki/github-workflow-for-submitting-pull-requests) steps, particularly the *Working on a topic branch* section.

## Indenting

Indenting on code should be 2 spaces per indent. There is a vim modeline at the end of each code file to set this for you if you use vim and have modeline enabled.

## Commit Messages

Commit message must be clear and concise, detailing exactly what problem the commit is fixing, or what it is contributing to the code base.

## Pull Requests

I will aim to review your pull request within 24 hours, then either merge it or provide feedback for you. Sometimes I am AFK for several days or more though so please be patient if I am unable to action your pull request within 24 hours. If you have not heard anything within 7 days, please do ping me.

## Licensing

You must accept to have your code released under the GPLv2 with the rest of the project.
