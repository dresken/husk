This iptables compiler is aimed to improve the readability of iptables rules
and allow them to be expessed in a somewhat more 'freeform' fashion compared
to normal 'raw' iptables rules.

There is still structure (of course) however there is room to play. Keywords
must be declared (such as 'protocol' and 'port') to avoid ambiguity in
compilation, however case is generally not cared about.

I welcome feedback and suggestions for features and improvements :)
